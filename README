NAME
    Algorithm::ScheduledPath - find scheduled paths in a directed graph

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to find scheduled paths in directed graph.

    In less technical parlance, it lets you do things like take a series of
    interconnected bus routes and determine a schedule of how to get from
    point 'A' to point 'B' (noting any transfers in between).

CAVEATS
    This module does not do any kind of sophisticated searching techniques
    for finding paths or determining the most efficient schedule. It is a
    hand-rolled recursive method that appears correct but I have not done
    any proofs of the method. The sorting techniques are certainly not
    optimized. It has not been tested on huge datasets.
