Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::ScheduledPath.

0.41  Nov 14 2004 (Developer Version)
	- path_id, origin and destination can be objects so long as they
	  have string conversion and comparison overloaded; likewise,
	  depart_time and arrive_time can be objects so long as they too
          have numeric conversion and comparison overloaded.
	* copy methods renamed to clone
	* uses Clone module
	- more documentation updates
	- when copying edge, warning when data contains a reference
	* interface for Edge::new constructor is changed: it no longer
          accepts hash references for arguments
	* uses Class::Meta instead of Class::Accessor
	- modules register warnings (warnings only when enabled)
	- added more tests
	- Path::add_edge checks that arrive_time >= depart_time
	* requires Test::Exception and Test::Warn for tests
	- added use of callback in eg/bus.pl demo
	- added callback option in find_paths
	- corrected typos in documentation

0.40  Nov 12 2004 (Developer Version)
	- updated README
	* requires Carp::Assert for debugging behavior
	- fixed bug with fetching earliest times
	- added latest time value option in find_paths
	- secondary sorting order by travel time
	- added rudimentary test for cycles (tests need improvement)
	- fixed bug in Edge::copy method (rt.cpan.org #8370)
	- Edge::copy method only copies defined attributes
	- updated/added documentation
	- added Path::copy method for completeness sake
	* aliases for compatability removed
	- if a hash is passed to Path::add_edges method, it will pass the
	  hash to Edge::new
	* changed find_routes to find_paths since the interface has
	  been changed
	- updated code in find_routes method
	- fixed compressed method bug (rt.cpan.org bug #8351)
	- added copy method to Edge module
	- Path module will croak if edges are not connected

 	- modified example script to includes cases where bug shows up
	- in modules, renamed *_leg functions to *_edge
          (though aliases were added for compatability)
